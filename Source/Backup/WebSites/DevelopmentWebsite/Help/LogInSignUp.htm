<b>Why do I need to sign up?</b><br />
Your Tribute requests that users sign up before posting content for your security and privacy. By requiring users to register we have better control over the content added to the website. Don't worry, registration is safe and secure and we will never give your email address to a third party.
<br /><br />
<b>What do I need to sign up?</b><br />
Signing up with Your Tribute is quick and easy. Just provide us with your name, email address, location and desired username/password.
<br /><br />
After sign up you will automatically be logged in to Your Tribute so that you can start adding content immediately.
<br /><br />
We will send you a confirmation email with your login details to the email you provided. Keep this email on file in case you forget your log in information in the future.
<br /><br />
<b>What if I don't receive a confirmation email?</b><br />
If your confirmation does not arrive in 10 minutes, we recommend that you check your spam or junk email folder. Mark us as a safe sender so you don't miss important emails in the future. If you still cannot find the email, confirm that you are checking the same email address you used when signing up.
<br /><br />
Note that some internet service providers block emails. If you need your confirmation email resent, or sent to a different email address, please contact our support team using the "Contact" link at the bottom of the page.
<br /><br />
<b>It says my email address already exists.</b><br />
You may only sign up for one Your Tribute account per email address. 
<br /><br />
If you have forgotten your password, click the "Log in" link at the top right of the page and click the "Did you forget your password?" link. You will be asked to enter your email address you used to create your account. Click "Submit" and you will receive an email shortly with your password.
